# Sales-_Data
The Case of the Messy Sales Data 🕵️‍♂️
A Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Project for the Elevate Data Analyst Internship.

The Mission
The objective was simple, yet crucial: to take a raw, chaotic sales dataset and transform it into a pristine, reliable source of information ready for analysis. This operation involved tracking down inconsistencies, cleaning up the evidence, and preparing the final file for the analytics team.

Clean and Structured dataset (cleaned_sales_data.csv) where all known issues have been resolved. The data is now reliable and ready for the next stage of its journey: in-depth analysis and visualization.
